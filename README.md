Front-End Nanodegree: Arcade Game
===============================

# Indroduction
This is my project for front-end Udacity nanodegree program. It's just a simple game to practice Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML% Canvas.

## How to Play
Choose one of five heros with arrow keys and then select him with Enter on keyboard. Then you need to collect as much stars as you can and reach to the sea without collision with enemy bugs! You have three lives, that means you have tree chance to finish the game or you should try again. You can try again with space key.
